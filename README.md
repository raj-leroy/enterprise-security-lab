Enterprise Security Lab: Active Directory Attack & Detection

This project simulates a small enterprise Windows domain to demonstrate hands-on skills in identity management, authentication monitoring, and security event correlation. A Windows Server domain controller and Windows 11 client were deployed to generate, collect, and analyze real Active Directory security events.

The lab focuses on detecting account creation, privilege escalation, and authentication activity using native Windows logging. Events were correlated into a forensic timeline and mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework to demonstrate adversary technique awareness.
